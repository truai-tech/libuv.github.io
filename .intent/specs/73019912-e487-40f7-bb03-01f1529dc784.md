## Feature: Personalized Welcome Messages

**Description:**

This feature introduces personalized welcome messages for users upon login, tailored to their subscription tier. The goal is to enhance user engagement and provide a sense of exclusivity for premium subscribers.

**User Story:**

As a user, I want to see a welcome message that is relevant to my subscription tier so that I feel valued and understand the benefits of my subscription.

**Details:**

*   **Subscription Tiers:** The system will differentiate between at least two subscription tiers: "Basic" and "Premium".
*   **Welcome Message Content:**
    *   **Basic Tier:** A standard welcome message, such as "Welcome back, [Username]!".
    *   **Premium Tier:** A more personalized and enthusiastic message, such as "Welcome back, [Username]! We're thrilled to have you back as a Premium member. Enjoy exclusive access to all features!".
*   **Display Location:** The welcome message will be displayed prominently on the user's dashboard after login.
*   **Customization (Future Enhancement):** In the future, we may want to allow administrators to customize the welcome messages for each tier through a configuration panel.

**Technical Considerations:**

*   The system needs to access the user's subscription tier information upon login.
*   A mechanism is needed to select the appropriate welcome message based on the user's tier.
*   The welcome message display should be integrated into the user dashboard.

**Potential Issues:**

*   Ensure that the welcome message is displayed correctly across different devices and screen sizes.
*   Consider the impact on page load time and optimize the message retrieval process.

**Affected Areas:**

*   User authentication
*   User dashboard
*   Subscription management
